	abstract = {Data centers have become a critical computing infrastructure in the era of cloud computing. Temperature monitoring and forecasting are essential for preventing overheating-induced server shutdowns and improving a data center's energy efficiency. This paper presents a novel cyber-physical approach for temperature forecasting in data centers, which integrates Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, in situ wireless sensing, and real-time data-driven prediction. To ensure the forecasting fidelity, we leverage the realistic physical thermodynamic models of CFD to generate transient temperature distribution and calibrate it using sensor feedback. Both simulated temperature distribution and sensor measurements are then used to train a real-time prediction algorithm. As a result, our approach significantly reduces the computational complexity of online temperature modeling and prediction, which enables a portable, noninvasive thermal monitoring solution that does not rely on the infrastructure of monitored data center. We extensively evaluated our system on a rack of 15 servers and a test bed of five racks and 229 servers in a production data center. Our results show that our system can predict the temperature evolution of servers with highly dynamic workloads at an average error of 0.52C, within a duration up to 10 minutes.},

	abstract = {Abstract. People who are blind can be at a disadvantage in social situations because face-to-face communication relies heavily on non-verbal cues. Lack of access to cues such as eye contact can sometimes lead to awkward situations, such as answering a question that was directed to another person. This problem is compounded by the fact that sighted people are not always aware of their use of these nonverbal cues, and they do not take this into account when communicating with people who are blind. In the long term, this can limit employment opportunities for people who are blind, can adversely impact their professional advancement, and can even isolate them. To address this problem, we propose a methodology for determining and enumerating the most important needs of people who are blind, as they interact with others in social situations. Next, we establish design guidelines for building a Social Interaction Assistant to provide access to essential visual information during social encounters for the visually impaired. Finally, we use our design guidelines to develop a wearable Social Interaction Assistant prototype that is aimed at providing this essential information in real-time, during social interactions. 1},

Our algorithm automates the process of transforming a 3D face scan into its canonical representation, eliminating the need for hand-labeled anchor points. The presented algorithm is designed to be a robust, fully automatic preprocessor for any 3D face recognition algorithm. The experimental results presented here demonstrate that our CFDM is robust to noise and occlusion, and we show that using such a canonical representation can improve the efficiency efface recognition algorithms and reduce memory requirements. Producing the CFDM takes, on average, 0.85 seconds for 320 times 240 pixel scans, and 3.8 seconds for 640 times 480 pixel scans (using a dual AMD Opteron 275, 2.2 GHz, with 2 MB Cache, and 1 GIG RAM). The CFDM enables both 2D and 3D image processing methods - such as convolution and PCA - to be readily used for feature localization and face recognition.},

These actions are a part of the larger and complex Instrumental Activities of Daily Life (IADL) making a drink and drinking. We collected data using small wireless tri-axial accelerometers worn simultaneously on different parts of the hand. Acceleration data for training was collected from 5 subjects, who also performed the two IADLs without being given specific instructions on how to complete them. Feature vectors (mean, variance, correlation, spectral entropy and spectral energy) were calculated and tested on three classifiers (AdaBoost, HMM, k-NN). AdaBoost showed the best performance, with an overall accuracy of 86\% for detecting each of these hand actions. The results show that although some actions are recognized well with the generalized classifer trained on the subject-independent data, other actions require some amount of subject-specific training. We also observed an improvement in the performance of the system when multiple accelerometers placed on the right hand were used.},

	abstract = {We introduce a massively parallelized test-particle based kinetic Monte Carlo code that is capable of modeling the phase space evolution of an arbitrarily sized system that is free to move in and out of the continuum limit. Our code combines advantages of the DSMC and the Point of Closest Approach techniques for solving the collision integral. With that, it achieves high spatial accuracy in simulations of large particle systems while maintaining computational feasibility. Using particle mean free paths which are small with respect to the characteristic length scale of the simulated system, we reproduce hydrodynamic behavior. To demonstrate that our code can retrieve continuum solutions, we perform a test-suite of classic hydrodynamic shock problems consisting of the Sod, the Noh, and the Sedov tests. We find that the results of our simulations which apply millions of test-particles match the analytic solutions well. In addition, we take advantage of the ability of kinetic codes to describe matter out of the continuum regime when applying large particle mean free paths. With that, we study and compare the evolution of shock waves in the hydrodynamic limit and in a regime which is not reachable by hydrodynamic codes.},
