Title: Jupyter Accessability Project

Tags: Jupyter, Accessibility

My university (Michigan State University) plans to scale up the use of Jupyter in our classrooms but we need to address accessibility issues before we can adopt the platform for wide scale use.  On behalf of MSU I had an external group conduct a preliminary audit of our current jupyterhub server.  Based on this audit we determined that finding ways to improve Jupyter for the following user communities would be a good start.

- Individuals who have some one of the more common types of colorblindness
- Individuals who use screen readers to help with understanding (ex. Dyslexia)
- Individuals with dexterity issues who cannot effectively use a mouse

For part of my Jupyter hub project I am going to try to address these issues.  My hope is that some people are already working on these issues and I can just integrate existing plugins or patches.  However, If these communities can not be found I will try to build one myself.  I am currently talking with leaders in the Jupyter community to see the best way to build such a community.  Feel free to send me an email (colbrydi@msu.edu) and I would be happy to include you in on the conversation once I figure it out.
