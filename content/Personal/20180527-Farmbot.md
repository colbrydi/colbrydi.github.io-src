I have been coveting a FarmBot (https://farm.bot/).  At $2500 to $4000 these farming robots are a little out of my price range. However, I guess if I had a big enough yard I would still be looking to purchase one of these. They are so cool, they will plant, water, weed your garden for you.  So much fun!  And you get to eat the product when you are done.

The company uses open source hardware so I guess I could try to build it on my own and save a little money. All of the tools are built using 3D Printing so there is that.  

This project would go well with my robotic composting project I want to build.
