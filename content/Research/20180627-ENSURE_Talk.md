I gave an autobiographical talk today to the [EnSURE](https://www.egr.msu.edu/graduate/ensure) (Engineering Summer Undergraduate Research Experience) students. I have given this talk a few times and it is noticeably different that most of my presentations because the EnSURE organizers asked me to talk about myself and how I got where I am (instead of research or teaching).  The first time I gave this talk it was really awkward.  However, now I think it is kind of fun to tell stories about the choices I made throughout school and my carrier.  I get a lot of questions when I am done so I like to think the student's enjoyed the talk as well.  Here are a copy of my slides:
