**Ugh! Rookie mistake!**  I just spent all morning working on my website and blog.  I was really happy with the improvements. I was making some modifications to the Makefile in the pelican folder to streamline my workflow when... all of my files disappeared.

**Rookie Mistake #1:** I unintentionally did a ```rm -rf *``` in the wrong folder and lost of of my work.

**Rookie Mistake #2:** I had not committed any of my changes to the repository.  All was lost.  

Sigh. Now I need to try to go back and remember what I did all morning.  

Lessons relearned:

- Commit early and Often
- Be respectvul of ```rm -rf *``` epecially when it is in a ```Makefile```
