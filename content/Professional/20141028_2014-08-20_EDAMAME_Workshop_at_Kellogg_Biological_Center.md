Attached are copies the slides I am planning to present at the EDAMAME
workshop. Information about the class can be found here:

This presentation is a little different than my previous ones since it more
for researchers outside of MSU and we are only really using the HPCC as an
example of the types of resources that they may be able to find at their own
institutions.
