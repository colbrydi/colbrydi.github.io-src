Our research team had an opportunity to see a demonstration of an [Olympus
two-photon microscope
](http://www.microscopy.olympus.eu/microscopes/Life_Science_Microscopes_FluoView_FV1000MPE_-
_Multiphoton_Laser_Scanning_Microscope_.htm).

This is not a simple field microscope; the entiresystem was mounted on a large stabilized table with a fairly powerful laserand the sensitivity of the microscope required the room to be in completedarkness.Much of the presentation was outside my area of expertise. However, ofparticular interest to me was the ease at which the technician was able togenerate beautiful, high resolution images using multiple modalities.  It would be fun to have a project that would allow us to play with one so Icould learn more about the technology and how it works. I hope the EngineeringSummer Undergraduate Research Experience([EnSURE](https://sites.google.com/a/msu.edu/egr-summer-research/)) students
found the demonstration motivating and not too technical.

The following is an image generated with the microscope of a rabbit tongue:

Green and Cyan are second harmonicgeneration imaging of collagen in the forward and reflected directions,respectively (and simultaneously with fluorescence). Excitation wavelength was
860nm and the emission was in the violet channels (430nm for SHG) (forward and
reflected) and red (reflected)."
