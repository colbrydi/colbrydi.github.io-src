I had fun leading a discussion on **Deciding Which Technologies to Adopt, and When** at the [2018 ACI-REF Virtual residency](http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2018.php) event in Norman Oklahoma. Since many of the participants were virtual I experimented with doing a Brainstorming exercise over zoom. We had local volunteers on typing in comments from our local participants and remote participants typing their comments directly into the zoom group chat.  I tried my best to use typical brainstorming techniques and repeat all of the comments so everyone could hear them. This was especially important since remote participates could not hear the local participants.

See a video of the discussion here:
