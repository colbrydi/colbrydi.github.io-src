I had a wonderful opportunity this summer to work with five undergraduate
students on my research. The students were part of a 10 week research program
and worked on different components of the _ChamView_ Project. This was the
largest group of students I have mentored at one time, and it was challenging
to coordinate all of their projects in a way that was valuable to them but
also helpful in moving the research forward. On Tuesday of this week, the
students presented their work at the Summer Undergraduate Research Forum here
at Michigan State:

  * Brea Myers. “ **The Variation of Accuracy and Precision in Ground Truth Points.** ” Presentation at the MSU Summer Undergraduate Research Forum, July 2012.
  * Jeremy Martin. “ **Automated Color Space Exploration in Image Processing** ” Poster presentation at the MSU Summer Undergraduate Research Forum, July 2012.
  * Patrick Korth. “ **Using reinforcement Learning with SIFT to Track Objects in Videos.** ” Poster presentation at the MSU Summer Undergraduate Research Forum, July 2012.
  * Shiloh Jordan. “ **Automated Image Measurements.** ” Presentation at the MSU Summer Undergraduate Research Forum, July 2012.
  * Jassiem Ifill. “ **Aiding Manual Image Annotation using A Kinematic Model.** ” Presentation at the MSU Summer Undergraduate Research Forum, July 2012.

Funding for these students was provided by several MSU affiliates: the
Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research; EnSURE (Engineering Summer Undergraduate
Research Experience); BEACON, an NSF Center for the study of Evolution in
Action; and SROP (Summer Research Opportunities Program).

Overall, I found the summer experience to be energizing and productive, and I
hope the students also found value in their research experiences. We made a
lot of good progress on ChamView, and I hope to summarize the results into a
paper or two.
