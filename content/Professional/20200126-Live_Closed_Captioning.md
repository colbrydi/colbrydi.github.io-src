Many MSU classrooms have two overhead monitors that project on two screens at the front of class.  Each room is equipped with a technology cart that has a desktop computer, overhead camera and laptop connections that can be used to project any of the content to either screen. Up until now I haven't really seen many learning benefit of having two screens in smaller classrooms.  However, recently I have been using one screen for my standard presentation and the other screen with a live close caption.  Here is a video with a few examples:

To get this to work I am using [Google Slide](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9109474?hl=en) presentations which have an option for live closed captioning.  Here are my steps:

1. Log into the classroom desktop with my MSU login/password
2. Open up Chrome
3. Log into [http://googleapps.msu.edu](http://googleapps.msu.edu) drive using my MSU login/password
4. Open a new Google Slides file and set the background to black
5. Start the presentation and hit the 'CC' button which appears at the bottom of the screen when I move my mouse
6. Attach the portable room microphone to my lapel and turn it on
7. Adjust volume as appropriate for room and test the captioning

Once I have closed captioning work on the right monitor, I plug in my laptop and use the technology cart interface to set the left screen and desktop monitor to the laptop input.  Now I can control my lecture content from my laptop and the close captioning will work on a mostly black screen.  

Obviously student's with a hearing disability (temporary and long term) may benefit from the technology but overall I have found many students appreciate the extra information. When I am excited I can talk fast and this helps students keep up with what I am saying. I also have had positive feedback from international students for which English is a second language.   

Another drawback to this approach is that I can't figure out how to download a transcript from the lecture. I full transcript could be useful resource for me as well as students.
