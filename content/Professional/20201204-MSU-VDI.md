Michigan State University (MSU) has a [Virtual Desktop System](https://tech.msu.edu/technology/virtual-desktop/) that is accessible to students and staff.  If you have an account you can access it from here:

- [vdi.msu.edu](http://vdi.msu.edu)

I find it is a great for when I need to do something in windows or I need a backup for jupyterhub.  Here is a video I made explaining how to use the system for my students.
