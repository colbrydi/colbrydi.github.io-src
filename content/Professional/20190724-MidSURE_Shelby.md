Raspberry Pis (RPis) are affordable microcomputers (approx. $35) that have the capability to revolutionize the accuracy and efficiency of data collection in basic laboratory environments. Recreationally, RPis can be used as a base for smart televisions, home automation or video games. However, by utilizing basic robotics and circuits in the workplace, microcomputers such as RPis can be programmed to automate data collection (such as temperature measurements or time laps photography) and output sophisticated plots, create response mechanisms, and other mechanical or electronic tools to automate a research and save significant amounts of researcher time while producing more precise measurements. In this project we are exploring the capabilities of RPis for graduate laboratories and developing curriculum to teach graduate students how to take advantage of this highly flexible and affordable technology.
