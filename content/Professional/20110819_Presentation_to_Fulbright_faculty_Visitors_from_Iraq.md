This week I had a unique oportunity to talk with a group of Fulbright faculty
from Iraq. I gave them a short presentation on how advanced computation is
used in research at MSU and then I gave them a tour of the HPCC server room.
Here are the slides from my presentation that I compiled from some of my other
presentation:
