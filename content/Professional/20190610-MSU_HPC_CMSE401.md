Last year, I attended a two-and-a-half-day community and curriculum building workshop.  It could not have been more perfectly timed. I was able to come up with a solid plan for my CMSE401 parallel programming course which I ended up teaching this last spring.  

This year I was not able to attend the workshop in Tulsa OK (darn jury duty!):

However, I did arrange with the organizer (Aaron Weeden) and was able to give a video conference presentation about my class.  Hopefully this year's participants found my talk useful.  Here is a link to my slides in case anyone is intertested:
