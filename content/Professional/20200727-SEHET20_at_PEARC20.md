I presented an overview of my CMSE401 course (methods in parallel programming) at the [SEHET20 Workshop Program](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/SEHET20_Technical_Program.html) put on by the [SigHPC Education Chapter](https://sighpceducation.acm.org).

The presentation ("The Design of a Practical Flipped Classroom Model for Teaching Parallel Programming to Undergraduates") focused mostly on how I designed the course using a flipped classroom model and jupyter notebooks.
