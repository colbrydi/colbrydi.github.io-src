This week I was invited by Dr. Ryan McFall in the [Hope College
](http://www.hope.edu/) CSE department to give a seminar talk about using
advanced computational hardware. This time I reordered my slides to be more
example focused and I think it made for a better presentation. Here is a copy
of the slides if anyone is interested:
