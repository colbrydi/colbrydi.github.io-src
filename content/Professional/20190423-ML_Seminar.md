I was asked to give a talk to Michael Murillo machine learning seminar group.  Michael put the group together as a first step to gather topics/ideas for a graduate level machine learning class that CMSE will be teaching in the fall.

In this talk I introduced a difficult machine learning problem in the area of Exploratory Image Analysis.  I explained why this problem is unique and not easily solved using machine learning. Then I introduced my ideas on how we plan to try and solve the problem this summer using machine learning and, more specifically, Genetic Algorithms.
