I just got done trying out our latest CyberAmbassador Curriculum developed specifically for the  [2018 ACI-REF Virtual residency](http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2018.php).

We had some growing pains related to getting zoom breakout rooms working with a large group of people calling in.  Some didn't have working mics, others work in a group room and could not talk, others just didn't feel like participating.  Overall though I think it worked out well especially during the second breakout when we had a little more time.  Check out the slides on the CyberAmbassador website:
