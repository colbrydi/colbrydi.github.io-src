This summer we managed to find a time to take my research team on a retreat (Road Trip!) to the lake (Noah, Abudit, Shelby, Lilly and Anna).  It was a great opportunity to get to know each other and really bond as a team.  We played games, had a boat ride, went swimming and even got some work done.  

Overall it was a great trip. I hope to be able to maintain this new tradition with future summer students.
