On Friday during the last day of PEARC20 there was a wonderful Research Software Engineers Community Workshop  (US-RSE) to discuss building and sustaining software development community.

I had the pleasure to be a part of one of the panels and gave a short presentation on my work on my CMSE802 course "methods in computational modeling".   This class is designed to teach Graduate Students from across campus the software endingeering tools they need to make robust and sustainable software.  The slides for my talk can be found here:
