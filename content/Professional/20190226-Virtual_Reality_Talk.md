A few weeks ago I was asked by Terence O'Neill to give a talk to the VR/AR seminar group being held at the library.  He wanted me to talk about our "Mobile beast" and show how we are using VR equipment in CMSE.  

The VR equipment had a bug and we could not get the demo working.  Oh well, I still think the talk went well and I was able to make a few new connections.  

Below is a copy of my slides:
