I was asked to give an "effective presentation" tutorial to a group of REU students at Texas A&M.  As I talked with the organizers we thought it would be helpful to do a two part tutorial.  The first is more of a technical, hands-on workshop on how to use Camtasia Studio and the second will be more about how to make an effective presentation.  I had fun putting the first workshop together and thought it went quite well. Here is a video:
