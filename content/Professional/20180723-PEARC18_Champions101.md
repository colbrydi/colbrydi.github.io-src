I had an opportunity to participate on the "Researcher Facing" Panel as part of the  [Campus Champion 101](https://www.xsede.org/community-engagement/campus-champions) workshop at [PEARC18](https://www.pearc18.pearc.org/).

The [Campus Champions 101 workshop](https://pearc18.conference-program.com/?page_id=10&id=work108&sess=sess123) explores campus research computing roles. The workshop builds on the Campus Championsâ€™ history and leverages the recent Research Computing and Data Professionals Job Elements and Career Guide that was developed by the March 2018 NSF-sponsored Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC) workshop. Opening sessions will cover (a) the Cyberinfrastructure ecosystem and (b) research computing roles and responsibilities, introducing four broad job families: researcher-facing roles, systems-facing roles, sponsor/stakeholder-facing roles, and software/data-facing roles. Short talks, panels and roundtables will cover three of these four roles: researcher-facing, sponsor/stakeholder-facing, and systems-facing.
