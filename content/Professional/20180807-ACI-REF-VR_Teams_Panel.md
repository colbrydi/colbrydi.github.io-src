Thank you Aaron Bergstrom (U North Dakota) for facilitating the panel discussion on **Teams of CI Professionals: Recruitment & Retention, Management, Team-building, and Motivation** at the [2018 ACI-REF Virtual residency](http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2018.php). My fellow panel members included:

- Jerry Perez, U Texas Dallas
- Derek Leydig, Pennsylvania State U
- Claire Mizumoto, U California San Diego
- Robert Ping, Indiana U

I thought the panel went really well with both remote and local panelist and both local and remote participants. We discussed all types of topics related to finding good people, mentoring students, professional development and institutional politics.  Go to the  [2018 ACI-REF Virtual residency](http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2018.php) and they should link to a video if you want to watch.
