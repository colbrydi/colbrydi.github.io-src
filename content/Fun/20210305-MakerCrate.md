For Christmas my family got me a box full of [MakerCrate projects from KiwiCo](https://www.kiwico.com/maker).  There were five kits in the gift; one for me to work with each of my kids and one for myself. We had a lot of fun putting things together.  The quality of the kits are outstanding, the directions are clear.
