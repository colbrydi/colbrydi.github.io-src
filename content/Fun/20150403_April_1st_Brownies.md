An oldie but a goodie with a modern twist. This year I printed out the letter
E on my 3D printer using Brown PLA plastic.

Then I put the Brown E's in a baking pan:

Cover with aluminum foil and tell the kids I made brownies for them.

The were a little disappointed but then quickly got into the spirit of the day
and played the same joke on their mom and nanny.  I even took some "sugar
free" brownies into the dentist with me and gave some to my brother and his
house mates.    

Happy April fools day.
