A great purchase for anyone with a 3D printer and looking for projects With the kids.

About a year ago I stubbled across [JJRobots](//www.jjrobots.com/) and I just love the idea of this company.  They sell a kit of electronic parts to maker hobbyists with access to 3D printers.   The idea is that you use your 3D printer to make the items and everything you can't print is in the kit provided by JJRobots.  They spend their time developing new products that you can print with the same kit.  For example, the kit I purchased can be used to build the following:

- Marker board writer
- Eggbot
- Robotic arm
- Motorized Camera slider
- Mini Robotic
- Air Hocky Robot

So far I have only built the Eggbot but it was awesome!  We spent last easter painting egg shells.

Unfortunately that print was tricky and my printer has been on the fritz lately (see other posts) and I haven't had the time/space to fix it.  However, my family and I are moving to a bigger house with a dedicated maker space so I hope to start working on projects again.
