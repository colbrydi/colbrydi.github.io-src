I am interested in purchasing a CNC machine for the shop space in our new house.  I think I would like to stick to something around $1000 but would be willing to invest as much as $2000 if I can find the right machine.  There are a lot of choices in this price range for hobby CNC machines.  Some other selection criteria include:

- Big cut area (I would love 4'x8' but that seems a lot) - I am interested in trying out thigns you can do with furniture.
- Small detailed work - I also have a few small projects that require detail.  I realize it will be difficult to have a machine that does both big and small.
- Open source hardware (I just like these projects) - Something I can easily modify with a rich user community.

During my initial search I came across the following systems and communities.

[Sienci](//sienci.com/product/sienci-mill-one-kit/)
[DiyLilcnc](//diylilcnc.org/bigshoulders/)
[Shapeoko](//carbide3d.com/shapeoko/)
[X-Carve](//www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve/)
[Openbuild community](//openbuilds.com/?category=cartesian-style-cnc&id=287)

I just stumbled across the [Maslow](//www.maslowcnc.com/) and got really excited. The large format capabilities (4'x8') with the really low price ($350) would leave more than enough in my budget to buy two machines.  In fact, I may be able to buy a Maslow and then use it to make the parts I would need another project like the DiyLilcnc (Although I just realized the kickstart for that is relly old 2011).  There are probably other projects.
