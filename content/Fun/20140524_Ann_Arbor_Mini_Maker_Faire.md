A few weeks ago we caravaned a group of family and friends down to the Ann
Arbor Mini Maker Faire.

hoped: there were plenty of robots, 3d manufacturing devices and other things
to touch and play with.  My oldest daughter (with help from her papa) even got
to do her first soldering using one of the "learn to solder badges" from the
maker shed
(<http://www.makershed.com/Learn_to_Solder_Skill_Badge_Kit_p/mkls01.htm>). I
heard a lot about this kit and it was better than I thought it would be:

I really like the size and the enthusiasm at the event and am looking forward
to the Detroit Maker Faire.

Can't wait until the next one.
