This one was a lot of fun.  We have a coat area down by the back door landing.
I used those plastic hooks with the special double sided tape that allows you
to remove the hooks without damaging the wall.  Unfortunate, the kids managed
to pull the hooks off taking some paint and drywall with them.  
  
  

Anyway my plan was to print put some new hooks using my 3D printer.  I thought
this would be the "cheap" way to  go.  I let my imagination get away with me
and ended up with something a little more expensive but also something unique.

The design is quite simple and consists of two hooks I found on thingiverse; a
fish:

And a round hook or bubble:

The overall affect is a fish tank with a bunch of fish skeletons swimming
around.

The design is a little odd bit visually appealing and has a ton of places for
the kids to hand stuff.
