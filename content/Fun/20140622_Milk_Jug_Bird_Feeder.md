My eldest daughter wanted to make a birdhouse/feeder.  It was the middle of
winter and I think she was thinking of building it out of wood. However, I
realized what she really wanted to do was decorate it using some extra
stickers she had.  So, we compromised and I cut out a hole in a washed out
milkjug.  


She spent the afternoon decorating and had a lot of fun.

Add a little birdseed and the project was complete.

Easy way to entertain a fidgety girl on a beautiful but cold afternoon.  The
seeds ended up on the ground although I don't ever think I saw a bird.
