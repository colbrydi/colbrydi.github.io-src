Title: Research

My current research interests fall into one of three categories.  

# Scientific Image Analysis
Since I was a graduate student working in the MSU Pattern Recognition and Image Processing (PRIP) lab I have always enjoyed helping other researchers do their science.  As an Image Processing expert I have been looking at ways.  My current research efforts in this area include:

- [Project InSight](//github.com/buckl113/Insight) - tools designed to help researchers annotate images using Jupyter Notebooks. My longterm vision for this project is to integrate machine learning into manual image analysis in order to reduce researcher time annotating images.

# Scientific Computing
As a former research consultant at the Institute for Cyber Enabled Research (iCER) I am interested in researching ways to make researcher go faster using advanced computing hardware. I currently am involved in two projects these include:

- **FPGA Research** - MSU has recently purchased two FPGA nodes with 6 FPGA Alteric PCI cards. I am coordinating a FPGA Taskforce consisting of researchers from across campus. I am also working with Drs. Brian O'Shea and Andrew Christlieb to conduct a graduate level course to explore implantation and benchmarking of the scientific computing 7 Dwarfs algorithms on the FPGA.

# Communication, Teaching and Education
I am also am very interested in what I call "Communication, Teaching and Education".  Currently I have two major interests in this area of research:

- [CyberAmbassador Project](//colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors) - is an NSF funded CyberTraining award to develop curriculum to teach Cyberinfrastructure (CI) professionals Communications, leadership and facilitation skills.
- [MSU Hub Fellow](//hub.msu.edu/hub-fellows/) - I am working with the MSU learning hub to make Jupyter notebooks more accessible to a wider audience of MSU students. This efforts includes people with disabilities as well as building a cloud base resource that can be used by anyone at MSU.
