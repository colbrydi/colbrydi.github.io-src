The Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE) uses a software tool called [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks for communicating with students in most of its courses including; CMSE201/202/801/802/413 and sections of 491 and 890. Outside of CMSE we have worked with other departments to use Jupyter for classes in CSE, Math and Physics.  Jupyter notebooks allow a dynamic mixing of formatted text, media and interactive programming.  If used properly, Jupyter notebooks seem to significantly improve communications between students and instructors compared to standard lectures and textbooks.

I am working with the [MSU Learning Hub](https://hub.msu.edu/) as a [Hub Fellow](https://hub.msu.edu/hub-fellows/) to investigate and hopefully fix some of the shortcomings of Jupyter notebooks as a first step to scaling our flipped classroom style courses and potentially moving them on-line.  Some specific tasks include:

1. Engage the Jupyter community to make Jupyter notebooks fully accessible to individuals with disabilities.
2. Investigate solutions to extend the Jupyterhub cloud server to all MSU students.
3. Extend the Jupyter model of teaching to compiled languages such as C, C++, Cuda and Fortran. (Current software is limited to interpretive languages such as Python, R, Julia and MATLAB)
