For years my wife has listened to me think about buying or building a 3D
printer.  At heart I am a cheapskate and can not justify spending a lot of
money on a toy.  I even had a <http://www.thingiverse.com/> account and would
spend time "liking" things I would print if I only had the
printer...

Well, I think my wife got sick of me talking about getting a printer. She not
only purchased it for me, but she got what I consider to be one of the top of
the line hobby printers: the Ultimaker 2 (<https://www.ultimaker.com/>).  I
think one of the things that finally convinced her is when she started
checking out thingiverse and found stuff she wanted me to print.

I have only had it for about three days, but I can truly say that the
Ultimaker 2 is a joy to work with. Although expensive, it came fully assembled
and I had it out of the box and making my first print in less than an hour.
It has been printing almost non-stop since then.  I have made over 24 prints
and the thing keeps running: puddle jumper, toy daleks, keychains, hooks, 3d
puzzles, all kinds of stuff. Here are a few pictures:
