Title: Planning a new Course
Tags: Teaching

This post describes a technique I use to plan an organize a course from scratch.  I learned this technique from Dr. Brian O'Shea.  

At Michigan State University (MSU) my official title is curriculum specialist.  I have the unique opportunity to help develop entirely new courses for a brand new department (Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering CMSE, EST 2015).  

My colleague (Dr. Brian O'Shea) showed me a nice trick to organize my semester and brainstorm ideas to do a better job with backward design and matching up my lessons to my learning goals.  I make a grid of 3 rows with 5 columns on a whiteboard.  Each box represents one week of the semester (15 total).  I then use post-it notes to write down ideas and place them on the board.  This is a brainstorming stage where all ideas are equal.  If I do this early enough I can leave the board up and move the sticky notes around as I think about my learning goals.

I recently moved away from the whiteboard and use a blank wall in my office. I created the grid with painters tape. This leaves my whiteboard open for other ideas and lets me put up a board really early. For example, it is june and I have a board up for my Spring Course on Parallel programming.
