Title: Garden Fortress

I love the idea of gardening. Specifically vegetable gardens where we can
grow, harvest and eat some of our food.  I've had a few gardens before, but in
our current house it is difficult to have one because our beautiful four
legged neighbors (deer) like to snack in our yard.  

  
I got this idea from a community garden just down the road.  They used an old
glass door as a small green house.  I am using the same idea but as a
screened-in space for a little garden.  
  
I got the door from our local Habitat resale store and it works great.  
  
Here is a picture of the final product. Note, that the door opens for easy top
access and the back can be easily removed also by lifting it off the screws I
use as hooks.

Here are a few pictures of my kids and me making the garden.
