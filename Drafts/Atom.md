# Trying out Markdown

I have been an on-and-off evernote user for a few years. Although I think it is a great product, especially for the average user. My needs are digressing. For example, I am doing a lot more of my work in jupyter notebooks which means I use a lot more markdown laguage.  This in tern means I am starting to really like markdown.  

I decided to see if I could move all of my note taking into a markdown system.  

Another reason to move in this direciton is I have been looking at a few static blogging system and am trying out posting my blog on github.io using pyrimd.  This static website generator lets me write blog posts using markdown and Jupyter notebooks. Very cool.

Finnally, when picking an editor for my macbook I decided on trying atom again.  Not only does it seem to have full support for markdown with lots of fun packages but I also found out I can install jupyter notebook bindings. Very cool.
