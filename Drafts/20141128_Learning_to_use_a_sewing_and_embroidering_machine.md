Title: Learning to use a sewing and embroidering machine

Tags: Maker, 3DPrinting

We are trying to turn our basement into a mini makerspace for the kids.  Quite
a few years ago my wife bought a fancy sewing machine that does embroidery
which I thought would make a fun addition.  My eldest daughter and I got
playing with the machine and it is quite amazing.  In no time at all we were
able to embroider a bow and make a cute little pillow.  I look forward to
seeing what we will make next time.
