Title: Lithophanes

I saw my first 3D printer when I was visiting the University of Notre Dame.
It was over 10 years ago, it was fairly expensive to operate and it printed in
a kind of expensive wax.  
  
Anyway, this was the first time I saw a lithophane.  It was a picture of
Marilyn Monroe that just popped out if you held it so up to a light so that it
is backlit.  It was just so cool that I really wanted to make some Lithophanes
when I got my 3D printer.  
  
Once I finally found some time I did some research and there were a few
programs on the web which would make lithophanes for me.

I tried a few but nothing excited me so I just wrote one myself.   I am very
pleased with the results:

If you just want a lithophane, we added them to my wife's etsy store:

If you already have a printer I am happy to send you the MATLAB code to
generate these for yourself.  However, I must warn you that it is not very
robust and I am reluctant to post it until I can add a bunch of error checking
and a little better user interface.  It's also written in MATLAB, ideally I
would like to change to something like Python but I am just quicker working
with MATLAB.
