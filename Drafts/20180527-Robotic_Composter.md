Title: Robotic Composter
Tags: maker, RobComp, 3DPrinting

My idea is to build a fully automated robotic composter that is able to decompose PLA plastic specifically from 3D printers.  Although advertised as recyclable and decomposable, PLA is anything but.  Recyclers don't like it because it has a lot of other materials and in order to break down the plastic for decomposition the PLA needs to go through an industrial "Hydration" process.  This process keeps the material at a high temperature (something like 140 deg F) for like a week (don't quote me on the specific numbers) in a high water environment. This process will cause the PLA to change state and enable it to be put into a standard composting system.  If you search the web, commercial compositors are the only way to do this properly and many of them will not even take the PLA.

My idea is to experiment and build a robotic "hot composter" which can get temperatures up to around 55-65c (130-150F) and use the composting process itself to hydrate the PLA. We may need to wait longer than a week and/or add a heating element.   As far as I can tell, no one is doing this on a small scale.  However, my hope is that hobbyists can figure out work arounds.  We have access to fairly advanced temperature, pressure and water sensors.  I don't see why we can't figure out how to build a small scale system that can take standard PLA scraps, use a computer to monitor the process and turn the PLA into compost.

The design process may take some time and a lot of experimentation to figure out.  However, I really think there would be some value to the community and maybe the environment.

I spoke at the Inverse Problems Symposium hosted at MSU and during the symposium I happened to connect with some graduate students doing research on PLA composting (what are the odds?).  Pooja Mayekar was my contact.
