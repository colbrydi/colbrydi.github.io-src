Title: Making Jupyter Accessable.

I am working with our university on a project to make Jupyter Accessible.  Accessibility is key if we hope to expand usage of the tool in our classroom teaching.


One problem is that Jupyter is not just one project, it is many projects and acessiblity touches each one in different ways.  For example:

https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/projects/8#card-2640156

https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen

I started the proecess by doing an independent audit.
