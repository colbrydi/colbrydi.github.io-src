Title: Psycology 1010 - Introducing students to Higher learning
Tags: Teaching

I realized the other day that I have been teaching for over 20 years.  I started teaching as an undergraduate Learning Assistant when I was a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology (1993 I think).  Phycology 1010 was a course for freshmen to learn how to adjust and be successful in college.  Upperclassmen (like myself) would lead teams of 5-6 students during in-class exercises.  The course explored all types of really useful ideas such as; how to take notes, learning styles, managing your calendar, putting together a resume, etc.

Since Psycology1010 was a required course for many students, I am not sure how many students put in the effort to see the benefit of this type of teaching.  Psycology1010 was a part of a broader program to increase retention and performance for freshmen without reducing the expectations or difficulty of their core courses.
