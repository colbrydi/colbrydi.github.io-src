We are spending time with the kids at our aunt and uncle's cabin in northern
Michigan.  This is an old hunting cabin but it is not exactly roughing it.
There is air conditioning and internet.  

  

I am worried that the kids are spending too much time inside on the devices.
At some point yestuday I banned the devices and told my eldest to go out and
build a fort:

She found some old ladders ready for the burn pile and built from there.

The fort turned out really well.  It is surprisingly strong and all of the
kids are proud of what they built.

It is also a fun place to picknick lunch out of the hot afternoon sun.
